These are my solutions for the first OOD practical on week two.

The first challenge was to take a pre made calculator class and seperate the method to print the aswer into its own class.

The second challenge was to create a secret diary in one class, and then to seperate it into classes we believed best suited it. 

This challenge is trying to help us to learn the importance of class cohesion and the single responsibilty principle.
